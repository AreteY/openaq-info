##A. The Organization and Community

**0. What is OpenAQ?**
    
OpenAQ is the world's first open, real-time and historical air quality platform, aggregating government-measured and           research-grade data. We're also a community of folks who are working to help each other do impactful work with these data     to fight air inequality - the unequal access to clean air. Our organization strives to be a cheerleader and connector for     other local organizations and individuals around the world working in their communities to fight air pollution.

That's what we do now, but we've also got an eye to the future. We want to scale what we're doing to include more data-source types, hold more workshops and help other groups convene their own meet ups, and even fund others to build open air quality projects in places where they are needed them most. 

The broad vision of OpenAQ is to empower communities to end air inequality, and our mission is to enable science, impact policy and empower the public to fight air pollution through open data, open-source tools and cooperation.

**1. Why does OpenAQ exist?**
    
Air inequality – unequal access to clean air – is responsible for one out of every 8 deaths in the world. The injustice of     pollution is often compounded by a lack of easy access to data in the most polluted places – access that, from Los Angeles     to Bangkok, has historically enabled communities to improve their air. Many governments, including those in polluted           places, publicly share air quality data but often in disparate or temporary forms. Last year, the OpenAQ community began       capturing these data and put them in a universal format for anyone to access through our open-source platform. This is the     only dataset of its kind open to the world.Using data, open-source tools, online engagement and workshops, we convene         various sectors of communities to fight air inequality. We share resources and ideas developed locally at workshops with       our global community. 
    
We do this because we think this platform can be _transformational_ for public health and the environment. And no one else was doing it. We even pestered some groups to do it who we thought could could do it better than us. When no one did, we started doing this work because we think it is too important for someone _not_ to.

**2. Who started OpenAQ and what motivated them to do it?**
    
The seed of the idea for OpenAQ emerged from a small open air quality project in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, launched by co-       founders Joe Flasher and Christa Hasenkopf along with Mongolian colleagues. Amazed at the outsized-impact a little open       air quality data can have on a community, Christa, an atmospheric scientist, fell in love with open air quality projects.     A few years later, she and Joe, a software developer, wondered: what would happen if all of the world’s air quality data       were made available for the public to explore? One day, they quit wondering, started building, and began asking passionate     people around the world to help.


**3. Who is part of OpenAQ and what have they built already?**
     
Anyone who is using data aggregated from the OpenAQ system, helping build the platform or building on top of the platform      in some fashion is part of the OpenAQ Community. Here's a map of usage to date (accessed Nov 2016) from Google Analytics:

**4. What type of organization is OpenAQ and why?**

We're currently a c-corps, incorporated in Washington, DC. Originally, we weren't sure what was the most sustainable          organizational path to keep these open data flowing freely, so we incorporated as _something_. Now we're working on our non-profit status because, well, our mission just aligns way better with that organizational type. But we've never done this before. Wanna help us?


**5. How is OpenAQ funded?**

You can see our current list of partners and sponsors [here](https://openaq.org/#/about?_k=0niwqz) (bottom of the page). We     generally rely on a combination of government, private-sector, and non-profit/foundation grants. 

   

**6. Why does OpenAQ require funding, anyway?**

We're a pretty bare-bones operation, but we do need funds to a) fetch, store, and serve out all these data, b) host            workshops around the world, c) pay our one full-time staff member, d) contract out services for cool enhancements that        make the data easier and just keep the system working, and e) a small bit of org overhead, etc. 
   
We're also looking with an eye to the future. We want to scale what we're doing to include more data-source types (we're looking at you,low-cost sensors), hold more workshops, and possibly even fund open air quality projects in places that need them most. 
   
   
**7. Can I donate funds?**
   
We don't accept donations from individuals. We're more interested in seeing individuals' skills applied to doing awesome       stuff with the platform and data. We seek to partner with organizations that are interested in fostering air quality           awareness and actions around the world. We think this is fairer than asking individuals, and we also think it is more         sustainable in the long term (...now, if you're a billionaire, exceptions _can_ be made ;) ). If your organization is interested  in sponsoring our work, please let us know (info@openaq.org).

**10. How are the data licensed?**

**11. How long are data stored?**

**12. What guarantees of the data accuracy are made of the data?** 

We don't make _any_ guarantees for data quality; that is not the goal of this platform. The goal of this platform is to       create a base layer of existing reported government-level, research-grade and other air quality data sources in the same       universal format.

###Contributing Data Sources

**17. How can I help contribute new data sources? What information is needed for a new data source?**

**18. I suggested a new data source, but I haven't seen it added yet. What gives?**

For government-grade sources, we generally have more data sources waiting to be added than we do bandwidth to insert them. We don't have any paid full-time (or part-time) developers, and rely on people to donate their time to add them. We're always seeking more help with those interested and with the skills to add in data sources to our system.   

For research-grade data, we're soon (as of 7 Nov 2016) adding in an automatic way to add in data. More on that in a couple of weeks. For now, we have to do it by hand, and this is time-intensive for our small band of hardy volunteers.

For non-research-grade low-cost sensors, we currently (as of 7 Nov 2016) have a method to insert them, nor visualize them responsibly. We are proceeding carefully with adding in low-cost sensor data. It is (tricky business)[http://www.nature.com/news/validate-personal-air-pollution-sensors-1.20195].
